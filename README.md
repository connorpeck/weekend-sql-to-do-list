To-Do List



## Description


This project took around 10 hours from start to finish. I created a full stack web application that took an input from the user, in this case it was an item that needed to be added to a to-do list. It then displayed it on the DOM as well as storing it in a database. The user had the ability to complete a task with visual feedback that the task was completed, delete a task, and undo a completion. I solved the problem of needed a place to keep track of on going tasks with a dynamic and simply UI.
